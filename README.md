To make a modification in this project, you first need to install Node.JS on your system to install the require dependencies.
After installing node and setting its path as your system environment variable, you need to go to your terminal and just type "npm install" and this will install all the required dependecies.

However, if you simply want to run this, just open the index.html file using a modern browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
